    <desc><![CDATA[Regardless of where you are staying, you will need to get to the Happy Isles trailhead of the John Muir Trail to begin your Half Dome hike. It's just east of Curry Village. Bus stop #16 is close to the trailhead, but buses do not operate until 7 am - way too late for a successful hike (a 5:30 am start is highly recommended). Near the bus stop is a nice restroom facility and is also a safe place to fill your water bottles. Continue down the bus road until you cross the Merced, then turn right and follow the signs (and the crowd) along the southern bank. In about 200 yards, you will see a US Geologic Survey river flow gage station.  Measurements are taken here and telemetered via satellite to USGS offices in Virginia. The roots of this station go back to 1915. In 1925, a continuous recorder was installed. Upgrades over the years have brought it to its current functionality and provide park officials with discreet as well as continuous water quality data.  The 1997 flood destroyed a bridge at this point; you can see remnants of the foundation.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Just past the gage station, turn left and head uphill. You will come to the large reddish mileage marker sign. This is the official start and end of your Half Dome hike. You will have to add all the walking you did from your bed to here for a complete mileage total. Turn on your GPS here. You are also at the beginning of the John Muir Trail, often just called the JMT. Although it was named for him after his death, Muir trekked along its path on his many journeys. The trail runs 211 miles on the crest of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Many people begin in Yosemite Valley and hike south to the top of Mt. Whitney, taking about four weeks. 

The John Muir Trail is a must-do journey for avid hikers. After you've done the Half Dome hike, you may consider tackling it someday. The JMT originated as an idea of a man named Theodore Solomons. Hailing from Fresno, he suggested a trail along the spine of the Sierra. Solomons hiked what would become today's trail with John Muir, Joseph LeConte and other Sierra Club members. He proposed the idea to the Sierra Club who agreed and in 1914, they formed a committee to begin trail planning, together with the State of California. After Muir died, the trail took on his name as a way to honor him.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Vernal Fall Foot Bridge]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[As you walk up the paved path you will get some good ups and downs to warm up. To your left you will a see large 1970's era rockfall that at one time was the site of a trail to Sierra Point. It has long been closed and is not recommended. Rattlesnakes abound here and it is pretty rough scrambling. Sierra Point was the one spot that a person could see 4 waterfalls from a single vantage point: Vernal Fall, Nevada Fall, Yosemite Falls, and Illilouette Fall. (Note the use of singular and plural. If a waterfall drops unimpeded it is a FALL. If it cascades, it is FALLS.)  Grizzly Peak lies just above you and to the left. You can easily see and hear the roaring Merced River to your right. As you continue, the view to the right will open up and you may catch a glimpse of Illilouette Fall streaming down in the distance. All the falls at Yosemite are fed by snow melt and they are virtually gone by late August, depending on the previous year's snowpack. 

In well under an hour you will arrive at the Vernal Fall Footbridge. Cross the wooden bridge midway and you see the 317-foot high Vernal Fall to your left. A water fountain and restroom are located here, just beyond the bridge. This will be your last source of safe water and it will also be your last flushing toilet opportunity. (3 outhouses are further along the JMT). Please avoid climbing on the rocks near the river. Moss covered stones and wet boulders create slippery and dangerous conditions. Almost every year, Yosemite Search and Rescue (YOSAR) performs body recoveries from the Merced. It runs at about 43 degrees F. In May and June, flows approach class V rapids under the bridge. Stay safe and keep out of the Merced. If you see someone in need of assistance you can dial 9-1-1 to reach emergency support. YOSAR is the group that performs most of the rescues of visitors who run into problems. Most calls are for problems that arise from dehydration, sprains and broken bones but other times they are a matter of life and death. YOSAR performs about 250 rescues a year, sometimes using helicopters.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[As you leave the bridge and head up the JMT, after just a few minutes you will be faced with a decision. To continue straight and get wet from the mist off of Vernal Fall or stay dry and take the longer but dry JMT. The JMT turns right about 150 degrees and continues up to Clark Point and Nevada Fall. If you go straight and through a control gate you will head up the Mist Trail. The control gate is closed during the winter because water off of Vernal Fall freezes on the upper steps creating a dangerous condition. The trail from Happy Isles to the base of Vernal Fall was constructed by George Anderson on contract to the new state of California in the late 1800's. Anderson was a Scottish sailor who worked in the park as a blacksmith, trail builder and jack-of-all trades. Remember his name. Later on you will find out about his singular accomplishment that allows us to get to the top of Half Dome. For now, marvel at the Mist Trail he constructed up to the cliff. Trail crews, the California Conservation Corps and volunteers continually maintain and upgrade the park's trails.

Suggestion would be to take the Mist Trail up during your morning hike. It will converge with the JMT at the Nevada Fall area. You will get wet from the spray in May and June but it will be shorter than taking the JMT. The Mist Trail route to Nevada Fall is 2.6 miles vs 3.7 miles via the JMT. If you want to stay dry, then the JMT is the way to go; but you will miss seeing some interesting sights. Later in the day you can return to Happy Isles on the longer JMT to save your knees from the downhill pounding. 

A couple hundred yards up the Mist Trail you will arrive at a control gate. It is closed during the winter when the steps ahead might be covered in ice. A junction is here allowing you to continue on the Mist Trail or go right onto the John Muir Trail. Regardless of which way you proceed at the control gate, look to your hard right and just a few yards up the JMT you will see a large granite rock to the left of the John Muir Trail. It is called "Register Rock." In the early day before the Government organized things, people built tails in the rough terrain and charged tolls to use them. At Register Rock people would write their name on the wall and continue on their hike.  In the James Hutchings book "In the Heart of the Sierras," he wrote that he saw this writing on Register Rock: "Camped here August 21, 1863, A. Bierstadt." Bierstadt was an early artist who captured scenic images. If you look closely, you can visualize the many now faded entries on the sloping side of the rock. One 30 feet up appears to read: "GERTRUDE SMITH 1881 F.K.C." 
 
The lower Mist Trail was carved out by Scottish immigrant George Anderson. Prior to his efforts, hikers had to go the longer trail - later called the John Muir Trail. He constructed that route on contract to the State. Anderson was a Scottish sailor and blacksmith who imagined visitors wanting to get up close to the many vistas around Vernal Fall. Modern hikers owe a debt of gratitude to George Anderson as one of the pioneers who helped shape Yosemite. As you head up the nearly 700 steps, pay homage to Anderson who constructed this difficult trail up to the cliff. Stephen Cunningham later built ladders up the Vernal Fall cliff allowing access above the fall. If you think today's steps cut into the side of top of the wall are scary, imagine going up a ladder system. Those ladders were then updated to a wooden staircase which, in turn, was replaced by the granite steps and railing you see today. In early season months, the spray off of the fall covers the trail and you will be soaked for about 20 minutes. It is suggested to use a cheap poncho to protect you from the spray. You may even see a circular rainbow in the spray on a sunny day. 

Near the top you will be out of the spray and can continue up the remaining steps. Off to your right you will see the Fern Grotto. This overhang is a quiet place to relax if you can negotiate the short climb up and have plenty of time. It is not natural. The use of dynamite carved out the huge gap.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[317 foot Vernal Fall was named by the first whites when they arrived in the valley in 1851. It is a wide symmetric fall that is postcard perfect. Stay behind the rail and do not go near the water. In July 2005, a man climbed over the rail and stood in the water a mere 20 feet from the edge and went over to his death. In 2011, there was 200% snowpack and the melt was long and strong. That July, ten people climbed over the rail and 3 were swept over. Follow the trail signs and stay to the right of the river. You will soon see a composting outhouse to your right. Through the trees to your left, you can see the Emerald Pool. It is a large bulge in the river with an inviting, but deadly area that may seem like a fun place to swim. This is prohibited due to the cold water, the current and the proximity to the fall just around the corner. DO NOT go into the Emerald Pool. As you transition from a dirt trail and begin to hike up granite slabs, you will reach a trail junction that can be confusing. There are two metal signs that both say "Nevada Fall."  Go left; in fact, on the hike to Half Dome, when you arrive at a fork - always go left. Here, if you go to the right, you will get to Nevada Fall, but via Clark Point and the longer John Muir Trail. After passing the Emerald Pool, very shortly you will cross the wooden Silver Apron Bridge.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Silver Apron Bridge]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[Under this wooden bridge, the Merced flows down a long smooth narrow chute and into the Emerald Pool. It is reminiscent of a water slide. The bridge provides a view of the water rushing down the chute. Despite graphic warning signs, people sometimes unwisely go for a swim which results in calls to Yosemite Search and Rescue. The water is very cold and hypothermia can result quickly. Be safe and please stay out of the water. You will continue your hike towards Nevada Fall through a quiet forested area. As you bend to your right, keep your eyes open for a wide open rocky space that is on pretty level ground on your right. 

This place has a fascinating history. In 1870 Albert Snow and his wife Emily operated a hotel here that was originally called the Alpine House but later went by the name of "La Casa Nevada" - a play on their name (in English it means The Snow's House). To allow access from the valley, Albert constructed a trail that switch-backed from Register Rock up to Clark Point and on to this flat area between Vernal and Nevada falls. Their view of Nevada Fall was recorded on photographs and drew many visitors. Their guest register book is in the collection of the Yosemite Museum. Some travelers stayed overnight before or after hiking to Glacier Point. Emily baked pies, doughnuts, bread and baked beans. The structure expanded and later included the 12-room original building, a 10-bedroom chalet, a woodshed, an icehouse, a log cabin and a stable.

By 1889, the Snows were old and feeble and soon died. It operated under another owner until a fire destroyed it (like most other Yosemite Hotels) in 1900. It was soon deemed a hazard and all remnants were cleared out. Almost no shard of wood or glass can be found today. Their once clear view of Nevada Fall is obscured by tall trees.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The upper Mist Trail continues the theme of man-carved granite steps. If the lower Mist Trail didn't spread your group out, these steps will. Hiking poles come in handy to help propel you up the steep incline. The early years saw the trail cut into "zig-zags" to accommodate horses, but today it is frequented only by humans. Pack animals now go up the JMT, bringing supplies and tourists. You travel far enough away from Nevada Fall to stay dry but you get a pretty good up-close look at the 594 foot gusher. The name in Spanish means "snowy" and the white foam reminded the early explorers of a cascade of snow. John Conway built the upper Mist Trail route. After a long haul up, the trail comes to a "T" with the John Muir Trail. Nearby is a 2-unit outhouse and to the west is Nevada Fall. Although it's only a 10-minute walk over to Nevada Fall, don't waste time, a suggestion is for you take the JMT back home and enjoy the fall later at the end of the day. It will be a longer walk back than the going down the Mist Trail, but easier on your knees. Take a short rest here; you are now approaching the halfway point of your hike to the top.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Little Yosemite Valley]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[Little Yosemite Valley (LYV) was once a thriving summer village for the Indigenous people of the area. Named by the first whites to see it (the Mariposa Battalion), this valley extends towards Merced Lake. The 2,000-foot-high walls sculpted by glaciers resemble the majesty of the main Yosemite Valley. You will be on the level trail for only about a mile so enjoy a brief rest after the steep climb up the Mist Trail. To the right of the trail, the Merced slowly meanders through. It is a good, safe place to filter water. The fall is far downstream so the water is calm. You could go for a swim if you were not on a mission to Half Dome. A quick look up and to the left reveals the backside of Half Dome. You can clearly see the main hump and sub dome. The cables are hidden from this vantage point. At the eastern end of the valley is a campsite for backpackers with wilderness permits. Little Yosemite Valley is the most-visited location in the backcountry. Some hikers elect to stay here and do the Half Dome summit in 2 days.  While this would afford an early trip to the top, permits are limited and competitive. Additionally, campers need to carry their gear up the 2,000 feet from the valley. Lastly, this area is known for its bear activity. Don't worry; no one has ever been killed by a bear at Yosemite - be it grizzly (through the 1920's) or black bears. A large (and the last) 4-unit composting outhouse is located to the right. Further down is a Ranger Station that supports this area of the park. On another day you may want to continue up the river towards Merced Lake and the High Sierra Camp there. A lottery is held each year for overnight slots at the five High Sierra Camps. Spaced about eight miles apart, they are a rewarding day hike and welcome you with tent cabins and hearty meals. You will soon depart LYV and head up the forested switchbacks towards Half Dome.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[As you head up the switchbacks, keep your eyes open for a metal trail sign pointing the way to Half Dome in 2 miles. The main trail splits to the right and continues as the JMT. To the left is the Half Dome trail. Should you go right, you will head towards Cloud's Rest. 

When you are ascending this forested area, you may be lucky enough to see Mule deer. They like the heavy brush and tree cover.  They are easily recognized by the shape of their ears, which actually do resemble mules' ears. The main valley meadows are frequented by these deer and are a common sight. Although they look like Bambi, these are wild animals and should be given space. Despite all the potentially dangerous fauna at the park including bear, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, coyotes and scorpions, only 1 person has been killed by wildlife at Yosemite. That was a 7-year old boy who was gored by a deer. More injuries have been inflicted on park visitors by mule deer than by black bears. A fully-grown buck can weigh up to 400 pounds. Don't feed them! Since there are so many deer in this stretch, you can rest assured that mountain lions are on the lookout for a meal. To give you calm, no one has been killed by a mountain lion in the entire state of California since 2004. It's estimated that only 5,000 of these animals are left in the state. They are also called pumas, cougars or panthers and can range upwards of 250 pounds. It is extremely rare to see one, so if you do, cherish the moment. Hunting of anything in a National Park is prohibited. 

Rattlesnakes are also common here. If you stay on the main trail you will be fine. Be cautious if you take a potty break (100 feet minimum from a trail or water). There are 14 types of snakes in the park but only the western rattler is venomous. They have a flat triangular head and are colored cream to black with splotches. Bites are also very rare. If you hear the rattle - move!]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[The Little Spring]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[The switchbacks will seem to go on forever, so rest and drink before you are thirsty. Nibble as you go. Pay close attention to this POI. A little known water source. Some guidebooks refer to a spring that lies off to the right a couple hundred yards. Don't bother trying to find it. You will soon walk within a mere feet of a reliable spring. It doesn't have an official name, some call it "The Little Spring." It is always flowing, albeit only a few inches deep and not bigger than a table top. But since it is not snowmelt, it can be counted on to be "running." You need to be alert and locate the Little Spring on your left. After you make a hard left switchback turn, watch for a downed tree that lies with its roots facing the trail. In the winter of 2012 a huge tree fell and landed on the spring. The trail crew has cut away to tree to allow access. Study the photos of this area. This is the last water between here and the top - and back! See Pg 143-146 of the 2nd edition of "one Best Hike, Yosemite's Half Dome."

Usually spring water that runs through soil and sand can be safe to drink, it is still recommended you use a water purification system before drinking from this spring. Remember the deer mentioned earlier?  Giardia and cryptosporidium are linked to e-coli in feces. These are two protozoa that will give you diarrhea in about a week. These intestinal parasites must be treated or you will get very sick and could even die. The spring is very shallow so do not stir up sediment. Hold the filter inlet just below the surface to avoid getting sediment into your filter and clogging it. Filling up here should allow you to get to the top of Half Dome and back to this spring before you need to refill. Hydrate here and add electrolytes - don't underestimate the difficulty that lies ahead. I've listed the GPS coordinates in case you can't see the spring.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Base of Sub Dome]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[About a half of a mile beyond the Little Spring, you will get a glimpse of Sub Dome with the backside of Half Dome looming above it. The trees get thinner and the views open up. You will know you are near the base of Sub Dome when a large flat area appears and several downed trees provide a nice resting place. Many people kick back and rest in the shade. Since there are no more outhouses, you should make a final stop in the woods before proceeding. Again, at least 100 feet from the trail. Dig a 6 inch deep cat hole if needed and pack out your toilet paper. Note: There are no toilets or places to go up top.

As you proceed up towards the base of Sub Dome, a Ranger may be present to check your permit. If everyone has one, you may proceed up the long grind of Sub Dome.  Although this formation is not specifically named on maps, the Rangers call it Sub Dome. Incorrect names include: "Quarter Dome" (a formation near Cloud's Rest), "The Granite Staircase," "The Switchbacks" or even "The Shoulder".  The most understated part of the whole hike is the 400-foot rise up Sub Dome. Many say it is harder than the cables. It is composed of a 2-way man-carved switchback granite staircase. It was built in 1919 when the cables were erected.  It lies above the tree line and is very strenuous. It can take you 45-60 minutes to get to the top of Sub Dome. Hiking poles help with the push up and provide stability on these tricky steps. You need to move as others going the other way descend. The steps die out about Â¾ of the way up and you have to watch for people descending to ensure you don't lose your way. A slow and steady pace is best. Pause often to enjoy the view.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[The Base of the Cables]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[When you finally arrive at the top of Sub Dome, you come face-to-face with the infamous cables. Photos do little to convey the task that lies ahead. You should have a total trip estimated time and turn around if you are beyond your half-way time. From here it can take you a long time to get up and back down the cables, depending on the crowd. You do not want to risk night hiking. 

First, a word of caution. If there is any storm activity nearby or you get the "smell of rain" - Do NOT go up. Lighting can travel up to 10 miles from its cloud source and those steel cables conduct electricity. In 1985, two men died after a lighting strike up top. Besides lightening, rain makes the granite very slippery and when combined with the wind can numb your hands, creating deadly consequences when attempting to descend. 

Assuming you are doing well, sit back, rest, drink and secure your poles, bottles and camera. The depression just before the cables is called the saddle. Here you get an appreciation of the steep areas to the left and right (I call them Infinity and Oblivion).

In 1870, Josiah Whitney, the Chief Geologist for California, looked up at Half Dome and said: "Half Dome is perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of all the prominent points of Yosemite which has never been, and never will be, trodden upon."  Just 5 years later, George Anderson, a Scottish sailor summited it.  Anderson was a valley blacksmith, trail builder and jack of all trades. He knew he could charge a toll for people wanting to go up Half Dome and perhaps even build a hotel near the base of what was then often called "South Dome." He mused of building a wooden staircase to the top. He set up his work area in a small cabin he built nearby. Using a method called "single jacking" he held a steel bar and hit it with a hammer to drill shallow holes into the granite. They were about Â½ inch wide and about five inches deep. He forged dozens of 7-inch iron eye-bolts that slid into the holes he drilled into the rock. They were held securely in place by small wooden pegs. He did this with bare feet coated with pine tar for a better grip. He had to stand on one spike to hand drill the hole for the next spike above. Up and up he went, building a crude ladder with about 50 of these eyebolts. Anderson carried a Â½ inch hay-bale rope up to the top using the spike ladder. He had modified a 900-foot length of rope by knotting five strands together with a sixth strand and a sailor's knot a foot apart. This was a convenient space for him  to grasp as he made the ascent. He then affixed the rope to the eyelets on the way down. At 3 pm on October 12, 1875 he stood on top! The way to the summit was now in place.

In the days following, he escorted several English tourists up. Sally Dutcher was the first women on top and John Muir is believed to have been the 9th person on Half Dome. The Anderson rope didn't last long in the harsh winters and was unusable in a few years. He died of pneumonia in 1883 and is buried under a granite rock in the park cemetery. Two adventuresome men, A. Phimeas Procter and Alden Sampson, took it upon themselves to replace the rope by dangerously lassoing the few remaining spikes. 

Other replacements were successful to varying degrees due to the winter snows until Hall McAllister, a San Franciscan and a member of the Sierra Club, offered to pay for the erection of the cable system to the summit of Half Dome. It was completed in 1919 and given to the park. It was suggested that it be called "McAllister's Cable Route," but that didn't catch on. 

In honor of the accomplishment, a small wooden arch was erected at the bottom of Sub Dome. You can still see the stone block remnants of the base of the arch. It is right where the rangers check for permits. Being made of wood, the arch didn't last long in the rough winters of the Sierra.  To remember Anderson, the work crew erected the following plaque at the arch. It's also gone.

      ERECTED 1919 UNDER THE AUSPICES 
             OF THE SIERRA CLUB 
               TO REMEMBER

    <name><![CDATA[Climbing the Cables]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[This is where you will find out if you trained hard enough. Although there is often a pile of old discarded gloves near the start of the cables, they are junk. Good thing you brought your own. Focus on the immediate 10-feet in front of you. Stay to the right side; the route is over 90-years old and is worn smooth. It's a 2-way system with people coming down on your left. Just lean to your right to let them pass. Crouch and keep your feet flat to maximize friction. It will be hard to use your legs at the 45-degree angle so pull yourself up using your back, shoulder and core muscles.  If you use both cables, your small pectorals will have to do most of the work, so the single cable rappel method is recommended. Go from board to board and rest. Pin your foot against the pole to brace yourself until the next board is available. Try not to get stuck between boards as this will make for a harder climb. Don't gaze out if you are afraid of heights. There are 68 poles pairs to the top. They are merely resting in holes - they will come out if you pull up. The 2 x 4 boards are loosely strapped and can unnerve you. The cables are not one continuous run and will be loose near attachment points. You will need to step over some discontinuities in the rock surface. If the crowd is thin, you should be able to get to the top in about a half hour. If you arrive late, you probably have to wait in line; it could take nearly an hour to reach the top. There is no one in charge and no rules. Be polite but keep moving. People may suffer anxiety attacks. It's OK to politely pass them. 

As you ascend the cables, keep your eyes open for holes in the granite. The cables were replaced in 1934 and 1984. Today there is interest in locating the actual holes that Anderson drilled with the intent of possibly nominating the Half Dome cables to the National Register of Historic Places.

The use of a homemade harness with clips is not recommended. If you fall you may slide down while hitting your head and garroting your body. If you intend to use a harness, get a real mountain climbing one that goes around your waist and thighs. You also need two shock corded straps with 2 caribiners. The rig is called a "via ferrata." You will need to release and re-clip 68 times going up and coming down. It will take a very long time. If you feel you cannot get up the cables, consider not doing it.

The Mist Trail will be a challenge for your knees but it will save you a lot of time. It may be wet so use caution. If you want to see something new, continue along the JMT to the Nevada Fall headwaters. The fall is almost 600 feet high. The river can be very dangerous with smooth rocks, so keep out! A good cool foot soak is fine. For a nice side trip, go down below the bridge where the fall starts to drop and look up at it. There is a protective railing, so it is safe. You can see the water as it jets out before heading down. Next, cross the bridge and continue on the JMT. You will pass an intersection with the Panorama Trail to your left that leads past Illilouette Fall and on to Glacier Point - a long way. Another day.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The cliff area with water seeping out of it is has been called both the Ice Wall and the Rock Cut. When the trail was built, dynamite was used to blast the path out of the rock. In decades past, people could use ice axes and climb the ice flow during winter. This is no longer permitted. Hike along the cliff and look back at Nevada Fall for a superb view.  To the left of Nevada Fall is Liberty Cap. It got its name from its resemblance to the knitted caps worn as far back as the Romans. They were worn by commoners and stood for Liberty. During the French revolution against the monarchy, the people wore Caps of Liberty to show solidarity. Gov Leland Stanford gave it the name "The Cap of Liberty" when he saw the resemblance to Miss Liberty on a silver dollar. Between the fall and Liberty Cap is the Upper Mist Trail - that rubble field is what you went up in the morning! It was originally a horse zig-zag trail that suffered constant rockfalls and was almost abandoned. Behind Liberty Cap is a small valley containing Lost Lake - a large marshy area. This is the way to the Diving Board and a wall climb called Snake Dike. This is only for experts. The region between Lost Lake and the Diving Board becomes very rugged with talus, cliffs, gullies and dense forests of Manzanita. Ansel Adams took his famous black & white photos of Half Dome here.

Look to the left further and you will see Mt. Broderick then the backside of Half Dome. You can make out Sub Dome and the saddle. The cables are just out of view. Grizzly Peak is the last formation as you pan towards the valley. Continue down the switchbacks - 29 of them to the bottom.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Not too long after leaving the Ice Wall you will rapidly descend and soon approach a trail split at Clark Point. The trail to the right loops back to the area of La Casa Nevada between Vernal and Nevada Fall. This route would make for a real long day. 

Clark Point was named for Galen Clark. When he was 39 he caught tuberculosis and moved to the Sierra forest to live with his ailment - but he recovered. He discovered the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees and served for 24 years as the "guardian" of the park in the years before the formal National Park Service was formed. He later wrote a few books about the park. He was instrumental in work that led to the Yosemite Grant that was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1864. This gave the federal lands of the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias to the state of California for "public use, resort, and recreation ... to be left inalienable for all time." The first such set-aside of land for public use.

This overlook affords a good view of Nevada Fall and the canyon across the river. From here continue down the never-ending switchbacks. Your knees will be thankful that you did not have to go down the Mist Trail. After reading the signage at Clark Point, go to the left and continue down an uneventful trail that is occasionally traveled by sure-footed pack animals. Give them the right-of-way. These are very intelligent mules and horses that can find their way back home by leaving little trail markers behind them. Watch your step. Soon you will hear the rushing Merced. You will eventually reach a metal sign that instructs foot traffic to take a right fork. Left is for pack animals and that way would add a lot of distance before you got back to Happy Isles. Next you will pass Register Rock and rejoin the lower Mist Trail. The footbridge will be crowded and you are very close to the end of your trip.]]></desc>
